        <p>Matt,
            <br>
            Thank you for working hard all throughout the year. Don’t forget to speak up occasionally because you are a smart guy. Good luck in your future.
            <br>
            -Mr. Pugliano

        <p>My 8th Grade English Teacher wrote this in my Middle School Yearbook and are words that resonated with me as a blend between a compliment and a call to action as I have gotten older.</p>
        <p>I don’t typically like to talk about myself, and the thought of writing an About section seems incredibly daunting with more of a preference to continue taking morning cold plunges. However, I tend to gravitate to the uncomfortable as by now it seems to be fairly common knowledge, particularly with the advent of Yes Theory, Gary Vaynerchuk, startup culture, and self help rhetoric from the likes of Jocko Willink (Extreme Ownership) and Cal Newport (So Good They Can’t Ignore You) that you grow the most challenging yourself and taking accountability for your actions and behaviors. And being honest I presume most people are aware that the greater the challenge == the greater the payoff. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction as Isaac Newton would say (albeit pertaining to the subject of force on physical objects). This means doing activities you don’t prefer to be doing due to difficulty, but should be doing. Take for instance powerful influential speakers like Greta Thunberg and Malala Tousafzai, changing the landscape and conversation on climate change and education and overcoming a host of challenges (being young and having credibility, strong opposition, etc.). I certainly feel the most satisfied after achieving challenging pursuits, be it qualifying for the Boston Marathon, leading (just in general tbh) college campus events, public speaking, serving in kids ministry, and bumping it out in hip hop dance class, a weekly challenge to loosen up and have presence on the dance floor as my dance teacher Ivy would say, even if you don’t remember the entire choreography. Quite a diverse range of activities, but all with some aspect of “speaking up” whether vocally, physically, and/or creatively as I strive to answer this “8th grade call-to-action”.</p>
        <h2>Why I do what I do</h2>
        <p>Learning how to think is what attracted me to programming. Knowing how things work is what attracted me to computer science. Speaking concisely and reaching audiences is what attracted me to learning languages (Spanish, Python, JavaScript, Accounting). I love connecting with people and getting revitalized by being social. This discovery was revealed from a variety of jobs (retail cashier, camp counselor, before-after school kids programs, event planning, etc.) and has brought me to the present working as a Technical Support Rep for a company specializing in legal websites for solo attorneys and small law firms.</p>
        <h2>Where am I going</h2>
        <p>You go to school to learn and get a degree, but along the way you also pick up bonus value that carries more weight than actually what you end up studying. My Finance Professor Atif Ikram once explained by looking forward you would then be able to back pedal and know what your first step needs to be. My Supply Chain Professor Adegoke Oke once explained why you never need to worry - If it's in your control, then you don’t need to worry because you can do something about it, and if it's not, well then there is no point to worry because there is nothing you can do. </p>
        <p>Going to university also sheds light on qualities you admire. Little acts of kindness that I would hope to perform in the same sincerity one day. My Finance Professor Lawrence Licon for offering an extra seat at Barrett: The Honors College graduation when my seating assignment got mixed up. My Accounting Professors Nancy Cassidy for challenging me and setting high expectations for her students. Clinical Professor Gregory Dawson for resembling such genuine kindness and authenticity within and outside his profession. Professor David Schreindorfer and numerous others for displaying such a passion for the classes they teach and the topics they love. My Barrett Honors Thesis Advisors Lisa Magana and Claudia Sadowski-Smith for their trust, patience, and guidance on a thesis (The Politics of Citizenship) in a lot of ways out-of-my depth.</p>
        <p>What I am trying to say is that while my career is important, who I hope to become and who I help is even more so. I also tend to view my future career as more of a bucket of interests I wish to pursue (language learning, software engineering, public speaking, starting a business) that is ever slightly changing as I acquire more skills, knowledge, and hindsight. At this point in time front end web development has been the point of intrigue, along with furthering my career in tech for the foreseeable future.</p>
        <h2>My Personality</h2>
        <p>If I had to describe myself as a bird (although no one was asking) I would like to think I am most like a Toucan. While colorful and full of personality that also have a remarkable ability to blend into their environment and in my view being acutely aware of when to be seen and unseen, when to speak and to listen, when to lead and to follow. And along the way my hope would be the more you get to know me, the more brightness and color I am able to show.</p>
