            <h1>Speaking Up</h1>
        </header>
        <p><q>“Thank you for working hard all throughout the year. Don’t forget to speak up occasionally because you are a smart guy. Good luck in your future.”</q></p>
        <h2>My Middle School English Teacher wrote those words in my yearbook. Both a compliment and a call to action, the perfect coffee blend.</h2>
        <p>I don’t typically like to talk about myself, and would rather continue taking morning cold plunges. But it is clear that others often miss out, when we don’t stand out. Speaking out means articulating constructive thought and executing deliberate actions to critically affect those around you. Jocko Willink (Extreme Ownership), Cal Newport (So Good They Can’t Ignore You), and Dale Carnegie (How to Win Friends and Influence People) would universally confirm this conjecture. Furthermore, who no better exemplifies speaking up than Greta Thunberg and Malala Tousafzai in respect to the conversation on climate change and education.</p>
        <p>Speaking up is easier, when you know yourself better. Often our achievements shine light into this very idea. Qualifying for the Boston Marathon, leading (quite challenging tbh), public speaking, serving in kids ministry, have shaped who I am. Even struttin it out in hip hop dance class: a physical and mental reminder to loosen up and have presence on the dance floor even if you don’t remember the entire choreography. Upon reflection all contain forms of “speaking up” whether vocally, physically, or creatively.</p>
        <p>Speaking up has brought me to where I am today working as a Technical Support Rep for a company specializing in websites for solo attorneys and small law firms and is now directing me towards where I wish to go: becoming a Software Engineer. Despite studying a completely different field in college (accounting and finance), I made a decision to see the direction I was going and realize that I wanted to make a shift. Learning how to think is what attracted me to programming. Knowing how things work is what attracted me to computer science. Speaking concisely and reaching audiences is what attracted me to learning languages (Spanish, Python, JavaScript, Accounting).</p>
        <p>Who I hope to become and who I help is paramount and I consequently reflect on where my life is going rather than where my career is going. I perceive my pursuits as buckets of interests I wish to pursue (language learning, software engineering, public speaking, starting a business) that are ever slightly changing. As the buckets fill up, I’ll have a better idea of what bigger bucket to pour into.</p>
        <h3>Final Words...</h3>
        <p>If I had to describe myself as a bird (although no one was asking) I would like to think I am most like a Toucan. While colorful and full of personality they also have a remarkable ability to blend into their environment, my self-imposed analogy to being acutely aware of when to be seen and unseen, when to speak and to listen, when to lead and to follow. And the more you get to know me, the more brightness and color I am able to show. They are also pretty good at speaking up.</p>
